# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-21)

**Core value:** Members know exactly what to train today, complete guided sessions with block structure and timers, see their progress accumulate, and advance through levels.
**Current focus:** Phase 6 - Weekly View (not started)

## Current Position

Phase: 6 of 11 (Weekly View)
Plan: 0 of TBD in Phase 6
Status: Ready for planning
Last activity: 2026-01-24 - Phase 5 complete (all gaps closed, verified)

Progress: [█████░░░░░] 45% (5/11 phases complete)

## Architecture Reset

**Date:** 2026-01-23
**Reason:** New documentation in `/docs/` fundamentally changes SPOM and session generation architecture
**Backup:** `backup/phases-4-5-5.1` branch contains previous Phase 4-5 implementation

**Key changes from new documentation:**
- 5 blocks (not 4): Initium, Nucleus, Deuteros 1, Deuteros 2, Athlos/Epikos
- Route-driven block assignment via Weekly Rotator (not day-based)
- Contraction type distribution required (CON/EXC/ISO counts per intensity)
- SPOM lookup per route (week x route -> intensity, wave, pattern)
- Format compatibility system (Tabata, EMOM, AMRAP, Complex, etc.)
- Level grouping: ALFA_DELTA, SIGMA, OMEGA (3 groups from 5 levels)

**New Documentation Analyzed (2026-01-23):**
- `Documento de Planificacion` parts 1-4: Block structure, SPOM integration, contraction by intensity
- `system-specs/` parts 1-5: 47-point technical specification defining deterministic engine:
  - Points 1-10: Objective, domain entities, IDs, normalization
  - Points 11-21: SPOM resolution, category hierarchy, intensity->budget, contraction rules
  - Points 22-31: Format taxonomy, compatibility matrix, parameter schema, exercise selection
  - Points 32-40: Prescription (dose, rest, ladders, tempo), validation, coherence checks
  - Points 41-47: Engine pipeline, determinism, logging/trace, test framework

**Session Generation Engine (from system-specs):**
The engine is a **deterministic pipeline** with 9 stages:
1. Normalize tables (SPOM, Intensity, Contraction, Formats, Exercises, Rotator)
2. Build week skeleton (days x level_groups x blocks)
3. Resolve SPOM per block (route -> pct, pattern, scope)
4. Derive budget per block (pct -> reps_budget, exercise_count, difficulty_bucket)
5. Pick format (compatibility matrix -> candidates -> tie-breakers)
6. Pick exercises (scope + bucket + level + contraction -> filter -> dedup -> ranking)
7. Prescribe (allocate doses, bind to format, ladders/tempo, rest, notes)
8. Assemble blocks -> days -> week
9. Validate (coherence, partial user scenarios, insufficiency summary)

**Key invariants:**
- SPOM is unique truth per (week, route) - no duplicates, no averaging
- Budget is TOTAL per block, not per exercise
- Contraction mix derived from pct, not chosen
- Format never adds volume, only distributes budget
- All decisions traceable via structured JSON logs

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 19
- Average duration: 4.8 min
- Total execution time: 1.6 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-foundation | 4 | 30min | 7.5min |
| 02-authentication | 4 | 11min | 2.8min |
| 03-shell-module-system | 2 | 5min | 2.5min |
| 04-spom-engine | 3 | 14min | 4.7min |
| 05-session-generation | 5 | 33min | 6.6min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 3 plans: 05-03 (8min), 05-04 (8min), 05-05 (4min)
- Trend: Stable velocity, gap closure plan was efficient

*Updated after each plan completion*

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- ~~**SPOM Rules:** Phase 4-5 require golden test datasets from domain expert before development starts (flagged in research)~~ **RESOLVED** - New documentation in `/docs/` provides complete data
- **Timer Accuracy:** Phase 8 needs real-device testing under various conditions (backgrounding, low battery, notifications)
- **Coach Override Patterns:** Need domain-specific design clarification (per-member? per-branch? temporary or permanent?)

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-01-24
Stopped at: Completed 05-05-PLAN.md (INITIUM Pipeline - gap closure)
Resume file: `.planning/phases/05-session-generation/05-05-SUMMARY.md`

**Phase 5 complete.** All 5 plans executed:
- 05-01: Pipeline stages with trace context
- 05-02: Session persistence and API endpoints
- 05-03: Fallback ladder and validation
- 05-04: Pino-based trace logging
- 05-05: INITIUM pipeline bypass (gap closure)

**Gap closure:** UAT Issue #2 resolved - session generation now returns complete 5-block sessions.

Next steps:
1. Begin Phase 6 planning (Weekly View)
