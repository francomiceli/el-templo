# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-14)

**Core value:** The admin app is fully operational for physical branches -- real member data imported, access control with soft verification, cash box tracking, enhanced payments with discounts and debt management, and role-based permissions for branch staff.
**Current focus:** Phase 61 -- QR Access Control / Subscription & Attendance Rework

## Current Position

Phase: 61 of 66 (QR Access Control) -- 4th of 9 phases in v4.1
Plan: 2 of 3
Status: In Progress
Last activity: 2026-03-17 -- Plan 61-02 complete (fixed schedule subscriptions and slot attendance API)

Progress: [██████████] 99%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 10 (v4.1)
- Average duration: ~12min
- Total execution time: ~116min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total  | Avg/Plan |
| ----- | ----- | ------ | -------- |
| 58    | 2/2   | ~30min | ~15min   |
| 59    | 4/4   | ~34min | ~9min    |
| 60    | 3/3   | ~52min | ~17min   |

**Recent Trend (from v4.0):**

- Last 5 plans: 61-02 (25min), 61-01 (23min), 60-02 (22min), 60-03 (5min), 60-01 (25min)
- Trend: Stable

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Merge admin apps: Net features rebuilt in Vue/Quasar within existing el-templo-admin
- Modular monolith: formalize src/modules/ pattern with explicit boundaries
- Constructor DI pattern for services (established in Phase 56)
- Resend over nodemailer for EmailService (Phase 57)
- Plan-first admin member creation with auto-subscription (Phase 57)
- Production seed uses CONFIRM_PRODUCTION_SEED=yes safety gate (Phase 58)
- Nullable column extension pattern for backward-compatible schema changes (Phase 59)
- [Phase 59]: documentType required in create mode only, optional in edit mode for backward compatibility
- [Phase 59]: CSV import script uses static imports for drizzle-orm to avoid dynamic import type mismatches
- [Phase 59]: 84 unique legacy plan names found, all created as archived subscription_plans on import
- [Phase 59]: Bulk migration sets pricePaid=0 for legacy-to-current plan migrations (admin adjusts later)
- [Phase 60]: system_settings key-value table for global config (grace period, future settings)
- [Phase 60]: Budget pre-calculated at subscription creation: ceil(durationDays/7) \* classesPerWeek
- [Phase 60]: fixedDays stored as JSON array on subscription record for per-subscription flexibility
- [Phase 60]: DAY_LABELS shared constant in subscription types for UI day display
- [Phase 60]: Conditional stepper step pattern using computed confirmStep for dynamic step count
- [Phase 60]: Grace period intercept bypasses auto-expire; getSubscriptionWithGracePeriod queries raw status
- [Phase 60]: SettingsService optional on SubscriptionService for backward-compatible grace-period-aware auto-expire
- [Phase 60]: Force check-in decrements budget to maintain accuracy despite bypassing all other checks
- [Phase 61]: Grace period fully removed -- expired subscription = immediate hard block
- [Phase 61]: QR scan immediately creates "confirmado" status and awards 10 AURA (no two-step model)
- [Phase 61]: subscription_schedules junction table for fixed-plan schedule slot references (replaces fixedDays JSON)
- [Phase 61]: SettingsService kept as empty shell for future settings extensibility
- [Phase 61]: Setter DI pattern (setBookingService) for SubscriptionService<->BookingService circular dependency
- [Phase 61]: Coach check-in from slot always allows action but returns subscription warnings
- [Phase 61]: Attendance undo uses AURA spend for reversal (graceful if insufficient balance)
