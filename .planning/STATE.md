# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-21)

**Core value:** Members know exactly what to train today, complete guided sessions with block structure and timers, see their progress accumulate, and advance through levels.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 10 (Foundation)
Plan: 3 of 4 in current phase (01-01, 01-02, 01-04 complete)
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-01-22 — Completed 01-04-PLAN.md (Frontend state & API)

Progress: [███████░░░] 75% (Phase 1)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 3
- Average duration: 8 min
- Total execution time: 0.4 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-foundation | 3 | 25min | 8min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 3 plans: 14min, 6min, 5min
- Trend: Improving velocity

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

| Plan | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 01-01 | Capacitor v7 instead of v6 | Latest stable from Quasar CLI, better maintained |
| 01-01 | Hash-based routing | Required for Capacitor mobile apps |
| 01-01 | Vite environment variables | Standard import.meta.env convention |
| 01-02 | Fastify over Express | Better TypeScript support and performance |
| 01-02 | Drizzle ORM with mysql2 | Type-safe database access |
| 01-02 | Database plugin pattern | Proper lifecycle management |
| 01-02 | CORS for web + Capacitor | Support both localhost:9000 and capacitor://localhost |
| 01-04 | Pinia composition API | Better TypeScript inference, aligns with Vue 3 best practices |
| 01-04 | localStorage for tokens | Simple, works across tabs, sufficient for Phase 1 |
| 01-04 | Auto-redirect on 401 | Clear auth state immediately, improve UX |
| 01-04 | Custom tsconfig | Quasar preset export issue, custom config provides full control |

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- **SPOM Rules:** Phase 4-5 require golden test datasets from domain expert before development starts (flagged in research)
- **Timer Accuracy:** Phase 8 needs real-device testing under various conditions (backgrounding, low battery, notifications)
- **Coach Override Patterns:** Need domain-specific design clarification (per-member? per-branch? temporary or permanent?)
